<h1>intro_to_c</h1>

Take a look at Caleb Curry [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz4MxDeEM6k) if you are interested in video format. He goes over some basic Linux/Unix commands which is very useful.  

<h3>hello.c</h3>
a program to introduce the following concepts:

<ul>
<li>function - a definition of a relationship between the input (our list of instructions or tasks) and the computer. Main is needed. </li>
<li>return type - int declares that an integer must be returned as an output.  We can pass that 0 (which means all OK) on to another program.</li>
<li>libraries - stdio.h contains the function Printf, so we don't need to write it.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Tasks</h4>
<ul>
<li>Ensure you have gcc, vim, man pages installed</li>
<li>Write, compile hello.c, using vim and gcc and run hello world</li>
<li>Using Man pages, look up gcc, and vim.</li>
</ul>

<h3>circle_radius</h3>

<ul>
<li>Make use of scanf to read input from a user in the terminal, then print the input into the terminal.</li>
<li></li>
</ul>

<h4>Tasks</h4>
